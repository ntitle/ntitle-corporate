        question: 'What is nTitle?',
        answer: 'nTitle is a powerful platform built on top of the Ethereum peer-to-peer network where game developers have full control over the sale of their games without the exorbitant costs and lack of marketing support they currently receive. And at the same time, gamers actually own the games they purchase along with the alienable right to lend, sell, or gift it to whomever they like.'

        question: 'Is nTitle just for gaming?',
        answer: 'nTitle is designed to give back control to both creators and consumers of digital products. We will start with gaming, but our blockchain based licensing platform can also be used for other industries like books, music, video, enterprise software, documents, certificates and diplomas.'

        question: 'What is the difference between nTitle and other gaming marketplaces?',
        answer: 'nTitle is a next-generation gaming platform. Unlike other platforms, nTitle will provide a reward system using gamification and other motivational tools that will allow both gamers and game developers to profit. Gamers will earn money, rewards and free games for helping to promote games and developers will build an army of ambassadors by connecting with gamers and profiting from their social reach. On top of that, nTitle will enable gamers and game developers to profit from a peer-to-peer market where gamers will actually own the game they purchase along with the alienable right to lend, sell, or gift it to whomever they like and developers will have full control over the sale of their games without the exorbitant costs and lack of marketing support they currently receive.'

        question: 'What is the purpose of a blockchain technology in a game trading marketplace?',
        answer: 'Blockchain technology has many advantages. The one that we focus on with our licencing platform is specifically "proof of ownership". If ownership, identity and authentication are established, then licenses and payments can seamlessly change hands through both primary and peer-to-peer markets.'
